# Database Desing with ER diagram
In this project, we have created a clear and concise Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to represent the database structure for the Allsvenskan, which is the top professional league for men's association football clubs in Sweden. The ER diagram is crafted using both Chen notation and Crow's Foot Notation, providing a dual perspective on the database schema.

This design:
*  Illustrates the relationships and entities involved in managing the Allsvenskan league data.
*  Facilitates understanding of the data interactions and integrity constraints within the database.
*  
The ER diagram serves as a foundational blueprint for database implementation.

# Process Modeling - QualityFood (BPMN)
In this project, I have developed a graphical representation of the cooking process using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). The model is organized into swimlanes representing different roles within the kitchen: the Kitchen Manager, Chef, and Restaurant Assistant.

Key activities have been meticulously documented to capture the detailed workflow, including:
*  Coordination communication with extra staff via phone.
*  Preparation steps, such as boiling new potatoes.
*  Quality checks performed on the dishes prepared.
  
This BPMN diagram ensures a comprehensive and accurate modeling of the cooking process at QualityFood, enhancing both understanding and management of kitchen operations.

# Snowflake Schema Data Model for Olympic History

Project Description
This project involves creating a snowflake schema data model to represent 120 years of Olympic history, using historical data from the modern Olympic Games (Athens 1896 to Rio 2016). The dataset, sourced from www.sports-reference.com in May 2018, comprises three key areas: Countries, Summer Games, and Winter Games, and was provided in three Excel files.

Key Features
*  Snowflake Schema Design: Developed an efficient snowflake schema to organize and relate the historical Olympic data.
*  Data Integration: Combined data from multiple sources (Countries, Summer Games, Winter Games) into a unified database schema.
*  Visualization: Created diagrams to visually represent the data structure, enhancing the understanding and usability of the database.
  
Tools and Technologies Used
*  Excel: Initial data handling and preparation.
*  ER/Studio: For designing and validating the snowflake schema.

Final Product
The final submission includes:

*  An image of the snowflake schema.
*  A PowerPoint presentation detailing the schema design and its components.

Project Outcome
This data model provides a structured and insightful view into the vast history of the Olympics, facilitating easier queries and improved data management for historical Olympic data analysis.

Contribution
This project was completed as part of a group assignment for a course in data modeling. Each member contributed to the various stages of the project, from data preparation to final presentation.
